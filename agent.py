"""
Two-Stage Agent Review Workflow using LangGraph

This module implements a generic two-stage workflow where:
1. A react agent generates an initial response
2. A review agent evaluates the output
3. If approved, the workflow finishes; otherwise, it loops back to the react agent

The workflow is designed to be generic and work with arbitrary react agents.
